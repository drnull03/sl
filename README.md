SL(1): Cure your bad habit of mistyping
=======================================

SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as
you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at
all.

## My Modification 
I really like this software, but I really wanted to add an **interrupt handler** as it sometimes *interrupts me* during my work.

Thanks for understanding.
